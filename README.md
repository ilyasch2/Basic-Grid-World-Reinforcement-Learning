# Basic-Grid-World-Reinforcement-Learning

## Overview

This project implements a basic grid world environment for reinforcement learning. The goal is to train an agent to navigate the grid world, avoid obstacles, and reach predefined goals. The agent uses Q-learning to make decisions and learn optimal strategies.

## Features

- Customizable grid layout with goals and obstacles.
- Q-learning algorithm for agent training.
- Visualization of the agent's behavior on the grid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
